            Here is a past so deep our mind meanders to an airy thinness where thoughts cannot form, a phantom rustle.  Our choice: this scape may surge and recompass a new world, so warm and damp persistently.  Stand by the ribbonwood, the languorous palm, imagine the quiet roll of eon upon eon come and gone; now look again, identical: the future. You and I a momentary seam and slightest fiction. Before we were and after this is.

        The foot path to Mt. Sorrow. From there the shore, its azure slap primeval, and beneath that fulsome round a bygone adumbration stirs, till human voices wake it, and we drown.
