      This forest-- 120 million years. Protected, so our touch is slight. Look

            Here is a past so deep our mind meanders to an airy thinness where thoughts cannot form, a phantom rustle.  Our choice: this scape may surge and recompass a new world, so warm and damp persistently.  Stand by the ribbonwood, the languorous palm, imagine the quiet roll of eon upon eon come and gone; now look again, identical: the future. You and I a momentary seam and slightest fiction. Before we were and after this is.

    <p>A trail. </p>

        The foot path to Mt. Sorrow. From there the shore, its azure slap primeval, and beneath that fulsome round a bygone adumbration stirs, till human voices wake it, and we drown.
